# E-commerce
 Here I made a complete Ecommerce website/application from scratch using basic HTML, JS, CSS, and client-side Php. For more details on what my ecommerce website can offer, please read the README.

# App Features
 ## Login
 * System only allows registered users to make purchases, therefore the user must login/register. 
 * You can access the registration page using the login page.
 * Once the user logs in, a cookie is saved on the browser, therefore user can access the same account as long as they did not logout. 
 * If the user clicks logout, the cookie is destroyed, and the user must log in next time. 
 ## Navigation Menu
 ## Search Bar
 ## Item Details
 ## Add to Cart
 ## (CRUD) Cart Item Add/Remove
 ## Purchase Receipt
# Admin Features
# Potential Changes in Future Versions
